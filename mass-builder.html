        <h3>Mass Builder</h3>
        <p>Bodybuilding is about building muscle, minimising body fat and looking your physical best. Competitive bodybuilders train year-round in an attempt to increase their muscle mass and strength. They dedicate set periods of time (usually 20 weeks) to ‘MASS GAIN’ followed by another 10-20 weeks of fat loss, doing what is commonly termed CUTTING.</p>
